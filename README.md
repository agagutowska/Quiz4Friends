The objective of this project is to develop a web-based quiz game. Users can choose their preferred question category as well as the difficulty level. Based on this, the program generates a set of tasks for the player. 
Each task is displayed on the user's browser screen, and their responses are recorded. After completing all the tasks in the set, the game ends, and the player can view their final score.

Technologies utilized in this project include Java (17), Spring Framework, Spring Boot (3.1.4), Hibernate, Maven, H2 Database Engine, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap.
